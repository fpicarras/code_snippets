/** @file doubleLinkedList.h
 *  @brief Icludes all the functions to create and manage a Double Linked List Data Structure
 *  
 *      The lists created and linked to the next and previous node and have a poointer to a void* (Item datatype),
 *      the lists have a pointer to the head and tail.
 *      This file incorporates the functions necessary to manage this data structure, listed bellow:
 * 
 *      # createDoubleList ---> Creates a Double Linked List
 *      # deleteDoubleList ---> Deletes the list, freeing the allocated memory for the list aswell as for the Items
 *      # D_appendStart ------> Appends Item at the start of a list
 *      # D_appendEnd --------> Appends Item at the end of a list
 *      # popHead ------------> Return the content of the head of the list, deleting said node
 *      # popTail ------------> Return the content of the tail of the list, deleting said node
 *      # getHead ------------> Returns a pointer to the Head Node
 *      # getTail ------------> Returns a pointer to the Tail Node
 *      # getNext ------------> Given a Node, returns the linked next one
 *      # getPrev ------------> Given a Node, returns the linked previous one
 *      # getItem ------------> Returns the content in a Node
 *      # replaceItem --------> Given a Node and a new Item, replaces the content returning the old Item in the Node
 *      # deleteNode ---------> Given a Node, deletes it from the list, fixing the gap it leaves on the data structure
 * 
 *      The ability to append and remove Items at the start of the list allows this structure to be used as stack.
 *      With the addition of the popTail function, removing Items at the end allows the creation of queues.
